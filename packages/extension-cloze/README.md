# Cloze

This extension allows you to create spaced content in your markdown files using the `mark` tag. It is useful for creating flashcards or cloze deletions, where you can hide and reveal parts of the text.

## Usage

You can use the `mark` tag in your markdown files to create spaced content. For example:

```markdown
This is a spaced content example. ==Spaced content==
```
You can toggle the visibility of the spaced content marks by clicking. You can also show or hide all marks at once by using context menus in the markdown view.
